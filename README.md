Spoilt for Choice: User-Centric Choice of Battery Size and Chemistry for Battery-Electric Long-Haul Trucks

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etran.2023.100253

Following contributions of the mentioned paper, are provided by this repo:

- Comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of varying battery capacities for different use cases
This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis, which battery size is feasible for a long-haul BET considering charging power, payload, cell-individual vehicle restrictions as well as degradation effects.

- Novel investigation on the cost-effectiveness of oversizing the battery
We analyze the trade-off between rising investment costs and less need to replace the battery during lifetime, caused by the degradation of the cell. We model the aging effects based on cell chemistry as well as available charging power and transported payload.
	
- Detailed analysis of the cost-optimal and use case individual choice of cell chemistry
In-depth comparison of the two mentioned cell chemistries, regarding cost-effectiveness. We significantly enhance the state of the art, considering detailed aging modeling and the dependency on available charging infrastructure. We additionally conduct a sensitivity analysis in order to make the influence of our assumptions as transparent as possible.
